Example usage:

import machineer.resources.lxc as l
[ x.descr for x in l.LXC({'ClusterName':'myCluster'}).list() if x.isRunning ]
l.LXC({'ClusterName':'ngw','InstanceID':'salt'}).status().isRunning

Please note that a resource object is always initialized with a dictionary, keys from which may
than be used by its methods. Take care to provide sufficient information either from a
configuration file or in the constructor itself.
